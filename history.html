                    <p>The web has transformed from a simple document-sharing platform into a complex ecosystem of interconnected sites and services. Understanding its history helps us appreciate how far we've come and the innovations that have shaped today's web.</p>

                <p>The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while he was working at CERN. His vision was to create a system that allowed researchers to share information easily. The first website, published in 1991, was a simple text-based page with hyperlinks to other pages, laying the foundation for the internet. This groundbreaking innovation transformed how we access and share knowledge, paving the way for the dynamic and interactive web we use today. Berners-Lee's invention has since evolved into a global platform that connects billions of people and hosts an incredible diversity of content.</p>
